# AndroidContainerApp
An android application that can be used to categorize items in 'containers'. It features an ability to remind you of restocking when the amount of the items stored in them hit zero. 

Useful for managment when - for example - a company wants to keep track of a few wares that it buys from different vendors. After notifying the app that the amount of a certain wares hit 0 it will auto-create a shopping list including the ware name as well as the vendor

Supports multiple local accounts that can be used to store distinctive containers and items, as well as both English and Polish language.
